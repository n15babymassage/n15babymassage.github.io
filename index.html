	<!--<p>Welcome to my site! I'm Ruty Gross and I’m really excited to share with you my passion for connecting with your baby through baby massage.
	<br>
I was first introduced to baby massage when my first grandchild was born during the COVID-19 pandemic, prematurely, at 26 weeks. 
<br>
Due to hospital regulations, baby and parents were not allowed any visitors in the hospital.  Baby spent the first weeks of his life in the NICU – and I spent those weeks at home pining for some connection with the tiny person who had turned me into a Bubby.
<br>
B”H baby was discharged, and I got to hold him for the first time at 3 months.  I held him close to me, cuddling him, and could not put him down for 2 hours.  I desperately wanted to make up the missed time, so I signed us up for a baby massage class, where I got to learn hands-on techniques for providing baby – and myself – the touch connection that every human being needs in order to thrive.
<br>
This tiny preemie, whose doctors predicted a cocktail of life-long disabilities, is now a delightful little boy who is meeting his milestones and is a delight to all who meet him.
<br>
Before I knew what was happening, I had a pop-up group of mothers and babies meeting weekly at my home, wishing to watch me performing massage so they could do the same with their own babies.
<br>
I recognised a niche waiting to be filled, and so I signed up for a training course with the IAIM.  In January 2024, I completed my training, and became a certified massage instructor.
<br>
Since then, I have worked with many families, and am inspired anew each time I witness the change that comes over the mothers and babies, as they deepen their bonding and attachment which is innately part of us, and yet gets buried beneath the stresses of our modern lifestyles.
<br>
Baby massage is beneficial for all mothers and babies, not just those who are presenting with specific difficulties.  I hope you too will discover the gift that baby massage can provide for you!

"Infant massage is not a fad, it is an ancient art that connects you deeply with the person who is your baby, and helps you to understand your baby’s particular nonverbal language and respond with love and respectful listening. It empowers you as a parent, for it gives you the means by which you become an expert on your own child.”
