			<p>Infant massage helps to calm, soothe, and decrease the level of stress hormones in babies. This can be especially useful if you give your little one a massage as part of your nighttime routine. Some studies even show that 15 minutes of infant massage before bedtime can help your baby sleep deeper and more soundly.</p>

						<p>Alexander the Great brought enlightened Greek civilisation with him when he marched into the land of
							Israel in 332 BCE. Ultimately though, Greek culture would conflict with Torah values and ignite a clash of
							civilizations in the land of Israel during the Second Temple period. Come and see the 'beauty of Yafet'
							and meet some of the personalities that we faced off at the time of the Chanukah story and during the
							Hellenistic domination of the land of Israel.</p>
